## Project Overview
This project forecasts net power (PV generation minus residential load) for Delhi's residential sector using:
- **Photovoltaic (PV) power generation** simulation
- **Load forecasting with LSTM and XGBoost models**
- **Time-series analysis** of net power balance

## Key Features
- Accurate, Delhi-specific PV simulation using `pvlib`
- Robust forecasting via LSTM and XGBOOST
- Clear visual comparisons of actual vs predicted load
- CSV output for further analysis
